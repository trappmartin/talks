\section{Probabilistic Machine Learning}

\frame{
\begin{itemize}
  \item<1->Sum-product networks (SPNs) [Poon2011] are general-purpose probabilistic machine learning models that admit tractable exact probabilistic inference.
  \item<2->What are \emph{tractable probabilistic models}?
  \item<3->A class of queries $Q$ on a class of models $M$ is tractable, iff for any query $q \in Q$ and model $m \in M$ the computational complexity is at most polynomial.
  \item<4->SPNs admit many probabilistic inference tasks, such as marginalisation, in linear time in their representation size.
  \end{itemize}
